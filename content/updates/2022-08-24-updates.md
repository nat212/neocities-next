-   Restructured pages to have Layout in \_app.tsx
-   Changed updates section to link to /updates instead of the actual update ID since neocities doesn't wanna play nice :/
-   Thought about implementing shrines... Will see if it happens...
-   Add last updated section to updates page.
-   Changed 404 to not_found to work with neocities
